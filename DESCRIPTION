Description: Athlete monitoring data often comes in a form of 
    time series or panel data. This package helps in preparing
    these types of datasets using contemporary best practices
    which involve dealing with missing values, aggregating 
    data on a day-level, creating rolling averages and
    finally providing visualizations.
