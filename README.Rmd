Athlete monitoring data often comes in a form of time series or panel data. The goal of `athletemonitoring` package is to help in preparing these types of datasets using contemporary best practices which involve dealing with missing values, aggregating data on a day-level, creating rolling averages and finally providing visualizations.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `athletemonitoring` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) when it is available with:

``` r
install.packages("athletemonitoring")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mladenjovanovic/athletemonitoring")
```

## Example

To be added, but while you wait, here is the example from the documentation:

```{r}
require(athletemonitoring)

# Load monitoring data set
data("monitoring")

# Filter out only 'Training Load'
monitoring <- monitoring[monitoring$Variable == "Training Load", ]

# Convert column to date format (or use numeric)
monitoring$Date <- as.Date(monitoring$Date, "%Y-%m-%d")

# Run the athlete monitoring data preparation
prepared_data <- prepare(
  data = monitoring,
  athlete = "Full Name",
  date = "Date",
  variable = "Variable",
  value = "Value",
  acute = 7,
  chronic = 42, 
  
  # How should be missing entry treated? 
  # What do we assume? Zero load? Let's keep NA
  NA_session =  NA,
  
  # How should missing days (i.e. no entries) be treated?
  # Here we assume no training, hence zero
  NA_day = 0,
  
  # How should be multiple day entries summarised?
  # With "load", it is a "sum", with other metrics that
  # do not aggregate, it can me "mean"
  day_aggregate = function(x) {
    sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  },
  
  # Rolling estimators for Acute and Chronic windows
  rolling_estimators = function(x) {
    c(
      "mean" = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),
      "sd" = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE),
      "cv" = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE) / mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
  },
  
  # Additional estimator post-rolling
  posthoc_estimators = function(data) {
    data$ACD <- data$acute.mean - data$chronic.mean
    data$ACR <- data$acute.mean / data$chronic.mean
    data$ES <- data$ACD / data$chronic.sd
    
    # Make sure to return the data
    return(data)
  },
  
  # Group summary estimators
  group_summary_estimators = function(x) {
    c(
      "median" = median(x, na.rm = TRUE),
      "lower" = quantile(x, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)[[1]],
      "upper" = quantile(x, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)[[1]]
    )
  }
)

# Get summary
prepared_data

summary(prepared_data)


## Plots

# Table plot
# Produces formattable output with sparklines
# This will not work in the readme file, so just copy paste to your console
#plot(
#  prepared_data,
#  type = "table",
#
#  # Use to filter out estimators
#  estimator_name = c("acute.mean", "chronic.mean", "ES", "chronic.sd", "chronic.cv"),
#
#  # Use to filter out athlete
#  # athlete_name = NULL,
#
#  # Use to filter out variables
#  #variable_name = NULL,
#
#  # Show last entries
#  last_n = 42,
#
#  # Round numbers
#  digits = 2
#)

# Bar plot
# To plot group average
plot(
  prepared_data,
  type = "bar")

# To plot per athlete, use trellis argument
plot(
  prepared_data,
  type = "bar",
  trellis = TRUE)

# To filter out athletem variable and add Acute and Chronic lines to the group average:
plot(
  prepared_data,
  type = "bar",

  # To filter out athletes
  # athlete_name = NULL,

  # To filter out variable
  # variable_name = NULL,

  # Add acute mean
  acute_name = "acute.mean",

  # Add chronic mean
  chronic_name = "chronic.mean",

  # Plot last n entries/days
  last_n = 42)

# If you want to plot for each athlete, use trellis=TRUE
plot(
  prepared_data,
  type = "bar",
  acute_name = "acute.mean",
  chronic_name = "chronic.mean",
  last_n = 42,
  trellis = TRUE)

# Line plots
# These plots represent summary of the rollins estimators
plot(
  prepared_data,
  type = "line",

  # To filter out athletes
  # athlete_name = NULL,

  # To filter out variables
  # variable_name = NULL,

  # To filter out estimators
  # estimator_name = NULL,

  # Tell graph where the lower group estimator is
  # which is in this case 25%th percentile of the group
  group_lower_name = "group.lower",

  # The name of the centrality estimator of the group
  group_central_name = "group.median",

  # Tell graph where the upper group estimator is
  # which is in this case 75%th percentile of the group
  group_upper_name = "group.upper",

  # Use trellis if you do not plot for a single individual
  trellis = TRUE)

# Previous chart looks messy because it plot all athletes
# To avoid that, filter out only one athlete
plot(
  prepared_data,
  type = "line",

 # To filter out athletes
  athlete_name = "Ann Whitaker",

 group_lower_name = "group.lower",
 group_central_name = "group.median",
 group_upper_name = "group.upper",
  trellis = TRUE)
```

### Example for nominal scale

Example and documentation in development, but here is an example (graphs not ready yet)

```{r}
# Create nominal variable
monitoring$Value_nominal <- cut(
  monitoring$Value,
  breaks = 5,
  labels = c("Very Easy", "Easy", "Medium", "Hard", "Very Hard"),
  include.lowest = TRUE)


# Create a missing value
monitoring$Value_nominal[1] <- NA

# Run the athlete monitoring data preparation
prepared_data <- prepare(
  data = monitoring,
  athlete = "Full Name",
  date = "Date",
  variable = "Variable",
  value = "Value_nominal",
  acute = 7,
  chronic = 42, 
  
  # How should be missing entry treated? 
  NA_session =  "<<<Session Missed>>>",
  
  # How should missing days (i.e. no entries) be treated?
  NA_day = "<<<Day Missed>>>",
  
  # How should be multiple day entries summarised?
  # With "load", it is a "sum", with other metrics that
  # do not aggregate, it can me "mean"
  day_aggregate = function(x) {
    sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  },
  
  # Rolling estimators for Acute and Chronic windows
  rolling_estimators = function(x) {
    c(
      "mean" = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),
      "sd" = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE),
      "cv" = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE) / mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
  },
  
  # Additional estimator post-rolling
  posthoc_estimators = function(data) {
    data$ACD <- data$acute.mean - data$chronic.mean
    data$ACR <- data$acute.mean / data$chronic.mean
    data$ES <- data$ACD / data$chronic.sd
    
    # Make sure to return the data
    return(data)
  },
  
  # Group summary estimators
  group_summary_estimators = function(x) {
    c(
      "median" = median(x, na.rm = TRUE),
      "lower" = quantile(x, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)[[1]],
      "upper" = quantile(x, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)[[1]]
    )
  }
)

# Get summary
